        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">1. Payments Held in Trust</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Every paid transaction on {APP_NAME} flows through Stripe Connect Standard. Buyer funds are held by Stripe until the order&apos;s release conditions are met (typically delivery confirmation plus a weighbridge match where applicable). A 5% platform fee and standard Stripe processing fees apply at release.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Funds are never commingled with REALM operating accounts. You can review the full release timeline on each order page.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">2. Verified Identity (KYC)</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Sellers and carriers complete Stripe Identity verification before they can receive payouts. We verify business legal name, EIN/Tax ID, and beneficial ownership where required. We never see or store your full SSN or bank credentials — those go directly to Stripe.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">3. Verified Quality Testing</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Listings can carry one of three quality tiers:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 leading-relaxed">
          <li><strong>Basic</strong> — seller-declared, optionally backed by on-farm NIR readings.</li>
          <li><strong>Verified</strong> — independent lab feed test attached.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance</strong> — mandatory USDA-equivalent grade lab test with documentation attached.</li>

      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">4. Weighbridge Integration</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Where the loader has a certified weighbridge, gross/tare/net weights are captured directly and attached to the order. Buyers pay for delivered net weight, not listed weight. Disputes that involve a weight delta of more than 2% trigger an automatic review.
        </p>

      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">5. Dispute Resolution — 48-Hour SLA</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          Open a dispute from the order page within 48 hours of delivery. Our team reviews weighbridge data, in-app messages, proof-of-delivery photos and grade documentation, and issues a non-binding resolution within 48 hours.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Funds in trust are not released until the dispute is closed. Either party may decline our non-binding resolution and pursue formal arbitration or court action per our Terms of Service.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">6. Carrier &amp; Freight Safety</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Carriers must hold a valid USDOT/MC number, current insurance, and any state permits required for the cargo type. Livestock haulers attest to compliance with USDA APHIS interstate movement rules at booking time.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">7. Reporting Fraud or Abuse</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          If you see a suspicious listing, an attempt to take the conversation off-platform, or a request to pay outside Stripe, report it via the Report button on the listing, or email <a className="text-brand-600" href="mailto:trust@realmgroup.global">trust@realmgroup.global</a>. We action confirmed reports within 24 hours, typically with account suspension.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">8. What we cannot do</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          {APP_NAME} is a venue, not a guarantor. We do not own, inspect, transport, or warrant any listing. We cannot guarantee outcomes outside the funds-in-trust mechanism. Read our <a className="text-brand-600" href="/terms">Terms of Service</a> for the full picture.
